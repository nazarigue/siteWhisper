## Using Operators in Google Search 2

### Search for Groups in Facebook that are relevant for your business.

Use operators `site:`and `intitle:`.

My query looks like:

`site:https://www.facebook.com/groups/ intitle:localization OR intitle:localisation -game*`

Linkedin does not have public groups to search for in google, but you can go with your business interest there.

### Search for Public Google Sheets

### Search for Public Google Slides

### Search for Public Google Docs

### Search for Public Google Forms

### Search for Public Github Repositories

### Search for Public Google Forms
